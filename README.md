Project 
=====================================


> The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
> 

> You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
> 
> 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
> 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
> 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
> 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
> 5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


> 

Steps to reproduce this project
-------------------------------

1. Open the R script `run_analysis.r` using a text editor.
2. Change the parameter of the `setwd` function call to the working directory/folder.
3. Run the RStudio: the script `run_analysis.r`.  source("run_analysis.R")
4. Use data <- read.table("tidy_data.txt") to read the data.

> Good Luck!!
